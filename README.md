# Settlers of Catan AI Project

Welcome to our Settlers of Catan AI project repository! This project aims to develop AI bots capable of autonomously playing the popular board game Settlers of Catan. By leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, we seek to create bots that can make strategic decisions, manage resources, and compete against each other or human players.

## Project Overview

In this project, we represent the Settlers of Catan game board as a graph, where nodes represent hexagonal tiles and edges represent connections between them. The bots use heuristic search algorithms and decision-making processes to choose optimal locations for settlements, roads, and cities, as well as to manage resources and trade with other players.
